## Revision Naming Convention

Revisions `1.0` through `3.8` follow this standard:

**`x.y`**

`x` - Hardware Revision
`y` - Schematic Revision (Resets to 0 per hardware revision)

---

All revisions henceforth will use the following standard:

`ab.xyy`

`a` - Major Hardware revision
`b` - Minor Hardware revision
`x` - Major Schematic revision
`yy` - Minor Schematic revision

Schematic revisions reset to `100` on each time a major hardware revision is released. 

For example:
revision `42.108` would be:
- 4th major hardware revision
- 2nd minor hardware revision
- 1st major schematic revision
- 8th minor schematic revision.
