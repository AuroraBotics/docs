## Dev R4

The initial dev board revision before hardware 4.

The goals of this dev board is to:
- establish a proper development pipeline with the stm32 platform.
- evaluate the performance of the chosen micro controller
- determine next steps for hardware 4

Essentially, instead of redesigning a full hardware model each time, this will be the first realistic dev board, designed to be cheaper to produce, and is a minimum viable product, essentially. It should be used for testing basic functionality, which can be ported over to the next hardware version with no quarrels.
