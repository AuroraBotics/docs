# CAN Protocol


## The CAN Frame

### CAN 2.0B Frame
AuroraBotics devices use the the CAN 2.0B communication protocol to communicate with other devices.

Here is an image of a CAN frame:
![CAN bus frame](/CAN-bus-frame.png)
<Callout type="info" emoji="â„¹">
Note that the image shows an 11-bit identifier while CAN 2.0B specifies a 29-bit identifier
</Callout>

Here is the breakdown of a CAN frame:
| Field name | Length (bits) | Purpose |
| :- | :- | :- |
| Start-of-frame | 1 | Denotes the start of frame transmission |
| Identifier A (green) | 11 | First part of the (unique) identifier which also represents the message priority |
| Substitute remote request (SRR) | 1 | Must be recessive (1) |
| Identifier extension bit (IDE) | 1 | Must be recessive (1) for extended frame format with 29-bit identifiers |
| Identifier B (green) | 18 | Second part of the (unique) identifier which also represents the message priority |
| Remote transmission request (RTR) (blue)	| 1 |	Must be dominant (0) for data frames and recessive (1) for remote request frames (see Remote Frame, below) |
| Reserved bits (r1, r0)	| 2 |	Reserved bits which must be set dominant (0), but accepted as either dominant or recessive |
| Data length code (DLC) (yellow)	| 4 |	Number of bytes of data (0-8 bytes) |
| Data field (red)	| 0-64 (0-8 bytes) | Data to be transmitted (length dictated by DLC field) |
| CRC	| 15 |	Cyclic redundancy check |
| CRC delimiter	| 1 |	Must be recessive (1) |
| ACK slot	| 1 |	Transmitter sends recessive (1) and any receiver can assert a dominant (0) |
| ACK delimiter	| 1 |	Must be recessive (1) |
| End-of-frame (EOF)	| 7 |	Must be recessive (1) |
| Inter-frame spacing (IFS)	| 3 |	Must be recessive (1) |

### CAN over Serial / SLCAN
AuroraBotics devices also use [SLCAN](https://python-can.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interfaces/slcan.html) in order to allow for CAN control over serial communication.
SLCAN is also compatible with [socketCAN](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/can.txt) (a CAN protocol for linux devices).

Here is an example of a SLCAN frame:
| | Start-of-Frame | Arbitration ID | DLC | Data | End-of-frame |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| ASCII | 84 | 48, 48, 67, 48, 70, 70, 69, 69 | 56 | 48, 48, 49, 57, 48, 48, 48, 49, 48, 51, 48, 49, 48, 52, 48, 49 | 13 |
| Data | T | 0x00C0FFEE | 8 | 0x0019000103010401 | CR |
| Description | 1x 8-bit unsigned int describing frame type.<br/>`'t'` - normal frame,<br/>`'T'` - extended frame,<br/>`'r'` - remote frame,<br/>`'R'` - remote extended frame | 8x 8-bit unsigned ints - represents the arbitration ID in hex. | 1x 8-bit unsigned int - represents the DLC (data length code). | (2*DLC) 0-16x 8-bit unsigned ints - represents the payload in hex. | ASCII code for a carriage return. |

## Arbitration ID

AuroraBotics devices use the [FRC arbitration ID standard](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/can-devices/can-addressing.html).

This means that the arbitration ID is as follows:

Device Type - `01010` (10 - Miscellaneous) **or** `11111` (31 - Firmware Update)\
Manufacturer - `00001000` (8 - Team Use)\
API - See [API](/open_standards/can_protocol/API) for more info.\
Device Number - `000000` to `111110` (`111111` reserved for device specific brodcast messages.)
