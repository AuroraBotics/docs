# Set / Get Pixels Per Meter Frames

The Set and Get Pixels Per Meter Frames are used to control the known spacing of the LED strip which Lumina controls.
This allows for Lumina animations to be controlled via a specified velocity accurately.

The Set and Get frames use different API indices, be sure to check [CAN](../can) for more info, the data for these frames however, is the same.
